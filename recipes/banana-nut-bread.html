            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                   <li>3 ripe bananas, mashed</li>
                   <li>2 large eggs</li>
                   <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
                   <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                   <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
                   <li>1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                   <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                   <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                   <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                   <li>1 cup chopped nuts (walnuts or pecans)</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Steps</h3>
                   <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the Oven:
                        Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan to prevent sticking.</li>
                    <li>Prepare the Wet Ingredients:
                            In a large mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork or potato masher until smooth. Add the melted butter, beaten eggs, vanilla extract, and granulated sugar. Mix well until the ingredients are thoroughly combined.</li>
                    <li>Combine Dry Ingredients:
                        In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to a dense texture.</li>
                    <li>Add Nuts:
                        Gently fold in the chopped nuts of your choice (walnuts or pecans work well) into the batter. This adds a delightful crunch to the banana nut bread.</li>
                    <li>Pour into Loaf Pan:
                        Pour the batter into the greased loaf pan, spreading it evenly.</li>
                    <li>Bake:
                        Place the loaf pan in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 60-70 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs. Baking times may vary, so keep an eye on it.</li>
                    </ol>
