        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Shepherd's pie is a classic and hearty British dish that's renowned for its comforting and savory qualities. It's traditionally made with a rich filling of ground or minced lamb (hence the name "shepherd's pie") that's cooked with a medley of vegetables such as onions, carrots, and peas, all simmered in a flavorful gravy. The meat and vegetable mixture is then topped with a generous layer of creamy mashed potatoes, which forms a golden and slightly crispy crust when baked in the oven. This delightful combination of tender, seasoned meat and vegetables nestled beneath a velvety potato blanket creates a satisfying and wholesome one-dish meal that's perfect for chilly evenings and family gatherings.</p>

            <p>The appeal of shepherd's pie lies in its versatility, as it can be customized to suit individual tastes and dietary preferences. Some variations may use ground beef instead of lamb, while others opt for vegetarian or vegan versions, replacing the meat with plant-based alternatives. Regardless of the variations, shepherd's pie remains a timeless comfort food that embodies the essence of homey, nourishing cuisine, making it a beloved staple on dinner tables around the world. </p>

                    <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
                    <li>1 cup beef or vegetable broth</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                    <li>Olive oil for cooking</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Steps</h3>
                    <h4>For the Filing:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>a large, deep skillet or pan over medium heat. Add a drizzle of olive oil.</li>
                        <li>Add the chopped onion and diced carrots to the pan. Sauté for about 5 minutes, until they start to soften.</li>
                        <li>Add the minced garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
                        <li>Add the ground lamb (or beef) to the pan. Cook, breaking it apart with a spoon, until it's browned and cooked through.</li>
                        <li>Stir in the tomato paste and cook for a couple of minutes to enhance the flavors.</li>
                        <li>Sprinkle the flour over the meat and vegetables, and stir to combine. This will help thicken the filling.</li>
                        <li> Pour in the beef or vegetable broth and Worcestershire sauce (if using). Stir well and let it simmer for a few minutes until the mixture thickens and becomes a cohesive filling.</li>
                        <li>Add the frozen peas and cook for another couple of minutes.</li>
                        <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste. Adjust the seasoning as needed. Remove the filling from the heat.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>For the Mashed Potato Topping:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>While the filling is simmering, place the peeled and diced potatoes in a large pot of salted water. Bring to a boil and cook for about 15-20 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork.</li>
                        <li>Drain the potatoes and return them to the pot.</li>
                        <li>Add the butter and milk to the potatoes. Mash them until smooth and creamy. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>Assembling and Baking:</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
                            <li>Transfer the prepared filling to a baking dish or a pie dish. Spread it out evenly.</li>
                            <li>Spoon the mashed potatoes on top of the filling and use a fork to create a decorative pattern on the surface. If desired, sprinkle grated cheddar cheese on top of the mashed potatoes for a cheesy crust.</li>
                            <li>Place the dish in the preheated oven and bake for about 20-25 minutes or until the top is golden brown and the filling is bubbling.</li>
                            <li>Once done, remove the Shepherd's Pie from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</li>
                        </ol>
